<p><b>Parent-Staff Communication</b> is	ongoing	throughout	the	year.		Newsletters,	the	school	website	and	emails	
give	you	information	on	current	themes,	activities	and	upcoming	events.		Phone	calls	and/or	
emails	by	classroom	teachers	to	discuss	your	child’s	adjustment,	observations	and/or	
concerns	are	common.		If	you	feel	you	need	to	speak	to	a	teacher	or	the	director,	please	email	
or	call	the	office.		Teachers	can	be	reached	by	phone	or	email	after	the	school	day	is	over.	</p>

<p><b>Assessment</b> 	is	an	ongoing	process	at	WUNS.	Teachers	interact	with	children	in	their	play,	
conversations	and	observations	both	in	the	classrooms	and	during	outdoor	play.	Teachers	keep	notes	on	each	child,	writing	about	strengths	and	weaknesses	in	all	areas	of	their	
development.	Assessment	includes	checklists,	timelines	and	examples	of	the	children’s	
writings	and	pictures.	Teaching	teams	meet	weekly	to	discuss	each	child	and	plan	activities	
in	their	program	to	enhance	needed	skills	for	children.	</p>
      <p>
        <b>Parent/teacher conferences</b> are held twice a year (Fall and Spring). Teachers take note of
students’ activities throughout the year in order to learn about each child, plan for individual and
group needs, and communicate with parents on an ongoing basis. The Fall conference is
informal – teachers meet with parents, relate to them the activities and progress of their child,
and answer any questions they may have regarding their child’s learning experiences. The
Spring conference is more formal – teachers fill out an assessment form covering all areas of the
curriculum, including personal observations, in order to provide a well-rounded picture of each
child. The assessment is sent home before the scheduled conference so that parents have time to
read and understand the material, and form questions they may have prior to the actual meeting
