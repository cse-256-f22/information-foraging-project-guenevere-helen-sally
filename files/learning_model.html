      <h2>
        Philosophy 
      </h2>
      <p>The philosophy	of the nursery school is that children learn most effectively through play. Our	approach is	“hands-on,”	where children act upon	what they are learning and feeling.	We	
consider the process more important	than the product.</p>

    <h2>Vision Statement</h2>
    <ul>Washington	University	Nursery	School:
<li>Values	children	for	their	wonder	and	curiosity,	their	ideas	and	creativity,	and	their	
delight	in	play.</li>
<li>Values	families	for	their	traditions	and	goals,	their	commitment	to	home,	work,	play,	community,	and	their	dreams	for	their	children.</li>
<li>Values	teachers	for	their	vision,	their	job	in	children’s	play	and	achievements,	their	flexibility	and	skill,	and	their	commitment	and	compassion.		We	support	and	respect	what	we	learn	from	each	other.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<h2>Discipline</h2>
<p>The	staff	and	director	at	WUNS	work	to	maintain	a	very	positive	and	nurturing	environment	
for	each	child.		Classroom	limits	are	necessary	to	provide	a	sense	of	order	and	allow	teachers	
to	spend	as	much	time	as	possible	providing	a	stimulating	environment	for	each	child.	

When inappropriate behavior	is a continuing	problem, the	school will	work	with parents to	 understand	the	issue	and	make	appropriate	recommendations.		It	is	our	goal	to	make	school	
a	positive,	rewarding	and	enjoyable	experience	for	each	child. We	realize, however,	that we	
cannot meet	the	needs	of all children	and	parents. If	it is determined that a	child	is not	
growing	from his/her	preschool	experience at	the	Nursery	School, a	discussion	will be held	
with	parents	at	which	it	may	be	decided	that	this	program	is	not	appropriate	for	the	child.		
The	director	and	teachers	will	make	recommendations	of other preschool	programs	and	
relevant community services	if parents so	desire.</p>
